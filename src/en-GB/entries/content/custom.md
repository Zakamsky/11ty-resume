I participate in the full development lifecycle - from requirements definition to release, CI/CD pipeline configuration, and ongoing support.

In my previous role, I worked cross-functionally with analysts and designers to launch financial market analytics platforms across multiple international regions. These were not simply localized versions of a single product: each platform was adapted to specific regulatory requirements, business logic, and cultural characteristics of its target market. My responsibilities included designing and implementing reusable component architectures and unified solutions that ensured consistency and scalability across several related yet technically distinct products.

My most recent open-source contribution is [kapy.bar](https://kapy.bar), a social network built with Vue.js on the frontend and Python on the backend, where I focused on improving frontend architecture and overall user experience.
