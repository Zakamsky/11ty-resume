I participate in the full development lifecycle - from requirements definition to release, CI/CD pipeline configuration, and ongoing support.

My most recent open-source contribution is [kapy.bar](https://kapy.bar), a social network built with Vue.js on the frontend and Python on the backend, where I focused on improving frontend architecture and overall user experience.
