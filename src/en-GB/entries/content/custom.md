I participate in the full development lifecycle - from requirements definition to release, CI/CD pipeline configuration, and ongoing support. I have experience working in distributed teams of 5–10 people and leading a cross-functional team of up to 5 members.

My most recent open-source contribution is [kapi.bar](https://kapi.bar), a social network built with Vue.js on the frontend and Python on the backend, where I focused on improving frontend architecture and overall user experience.
