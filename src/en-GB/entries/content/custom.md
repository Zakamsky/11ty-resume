My experience includes the development of adaptive cross-browser applications, with a focus on reliability and performance. I try to see each project as a set of independent reusable components, such an implementation increases stability and facilitates refactoring.

Currently working on egambling with Angular and TypeScript. I do a lot of research to keep my skills up to date and expand my horizons.

I like projects with good structure and room for creativity.
