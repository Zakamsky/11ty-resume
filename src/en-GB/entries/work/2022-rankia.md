- As a Frontend Developer, I was responsible for delivering and maintaining client-side features with a strong focus on performance, scalability, and maintainability. I implemented dynamic lead capture forms, product comparison modules, and custom content blocks for a rich text editor, while continuously improving and refactoring existing functionality.

- I actively monitored and optimized performance and Core Web Vitals, achieving a 23% improvement in page performance metrics. I integrated a GDPR-compliant user consent SDK, introduced design tokens with direct Figma value imports to better align design and engineering, developed reusable Web Components, and contributed to fully SSR (JAMstack) projects to ensure strong SEO and high performance.
