- Frontend development, markup approval from markup developers, integration with backend API, and CMS PrestaShop. Legacy projects support, working with time logging, teleconferencing, and teamwork.
- I have developed modern layouts using the fallback to support older browsers. Tweaked the usability of the corporate wiki, and improved readability through typography.
